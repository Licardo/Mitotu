ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Risky Project Location:
-----------------------
The tools *should* handle project locations in any directory. However,
due to bugs, placing projects in directories containing spaces in the
path, or characters like ", ' and &, have had issues. We're working to
eliminate these bugs, but to save yourself headaches you may want to
move your project to a location where this is not a problem.
D:\Users\Administrator\Android studio workspace\MiaoTu3.0
                              -      -                   

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* LICENSE
* README.md
* ThirdPartyLogin.apk
* demokey.keystore
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => thirdPartyLoginDemo\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => thirdPartyLoginDemo\src\main\assets\
* libs\armeabi\libsmssdk.so => thirdPartyLoginDemo\src\main\jniLibs\armeabi\libsmssdk.so
* libs\ShareSDK-Core-2.5.9.jar => thirdPartyLoginDemo\libs\ShareSDK-Core-2.5.9.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-Facebook-2.5.9.jar => thirdPartyLoginDemo\libs\ShareSDK-Facebook-2.5.9.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-QQ-2.5.9.jar => thirdPartyLoginDemo\libs\ShareSDK-QQ-2.5.9.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-QZone-2.5.9.jar => thirdPartyLoginDemo\libs\ShareSDK-QZone-2.5.9.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-SinaWeibo-2.5.9.jar => thirdPartyLoginDemo\libs\ShareSDK-SinaWeibo-2.5.9.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-Twitter-2.5.9.jar => thirdPartyLoginDemo\libs\ShareSDK-Twitter-2.5.9.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-Wechat-2.5.9.jar => thirdPartyLoginDemo\libs\ShareSDK-Wechat-2.5.9.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-Wechat-Core-2.5.9.jar => thirdPartyLoginDemo\libs\ShareSDK-Wechat-Core-2.5.9.jar
* libs\SMSSDK-1.1.0.jar => thirdPartyLoginDemo\libs\SMSSDK-1.1.0.jar
* res\ => thirdPartyLoginDemo\src\main\res\
* src\ => thirdPartyLoginDemo\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
